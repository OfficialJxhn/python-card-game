# python-card-game
this is a card game i created as a practice NEA project during my A-levels.
this was created using Python and the use of MySQL to store the login credentials of the user
the game currently doesn't work as the MySQL server was my old laptop which no longer works, however in the future, i may get the game working on a remote server so it can work
the game is here to show what i was capable of during year 12
